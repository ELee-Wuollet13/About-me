    <h3>What I've made</h3>
    <p>I have taken this bootcamp once already. During that time I made a lot of ugly code and a few things I am proud of. Here is a  <a href="https://github.com/ELee-Wuollet13?tab=repositories"> link </a> to my Github account where you can paruse the good, the bad, and the super ugly.
      May a recomend the Roman numeral converter as an example of simplifying a problem and my previous version of this project as a benchmark for progress. Also keep in mind  that some of these projects are things you will be asked to do in the future, so take some notes but remember that plagerism will result in being dropped from Epicodus.</p>

        <h3>Who I am</h3>
        <p>I'm Everett. I'm 30 years old, a cis-gendered heterosexual caucasin male. I think 90's music is underrated, Terintino is a genious and an appriciation for the arts in all their forms improves a person in ways we don't value as a society but should. I was homeschool in increasingly rural settings through my teen years, have spent most of my 20's figuring stuff out and hope to use the skills and resources  of a coding career to improve the lives of other.</p>
