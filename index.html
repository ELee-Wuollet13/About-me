      <h3>What I've made</h3>
        <p>I have taken this bootcamp once already. During that time I made a lot of ugly code and a few things I am proud of. Here is a  <a href="https://github.com/ELee-Wuollet13?tab=repositories"> link </a> to my Github account where you can paaruse the good, the bad, and the super ugly. May a recomend the Roman numeral converter as an example of simplifying a problem and my previous version of this project as a benchmark for progress. Also keep in mind  that some of these projects are things you will be asked to do in the future, so take some notes but remember that plagerism will result in being dropped from Epicodus.</p>
